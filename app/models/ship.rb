class Ship
  # TODO: Implement the Ship class
  # This class should have the following attributes:
  # - name (string)
  # - type (string)
  # - booty (string)

  # TODO: Add attr_accessor for name, type, and booty

  # TODO: Add an initialize method that accepts these attributes

  # TODO: Add a class variable to store all ship instances

  # TODO: Add a class method .all that returns all ships

  # TODO: Add a class method .clear that deletes all ships
  # This method is used in the test suite to clean up between tests

  # TODO: Add logic to store each new ship instance when created

  # Note: This lab doesn't use a database, so you'll manage data in memory
  # similar to how it was done in the Sinatra version
