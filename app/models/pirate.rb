class Pirate
  # TODO: Implement the Pirate class
  # This class should have the following attributes:
  # - name (string)
  # - weight (string)
  # - height (string)

  # TODO: Add attr_accessor for name, weight, and height

  # TODO: Add an initialize method that accepts these attributes

  # TODO: Add a class variable to store all pirate instances

  # TODO: Add a class method .all that returns all pirates

  # TODO: Add logic to store each new pirate instance when created

  # Note: This lab doesn't use a database, so you'll manage data in memory
  # similar to how it was done in the Sinatra version
