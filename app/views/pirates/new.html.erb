<h1>Create a New Pirate</h1>

<!-- TODO: Create a form for pirate with nested ships using ActiveRecord -->
<!-- Use Rails form_with helper with the @pirate model -->
<!-- The form should POST to '/pirates' route -->

<!-- TODO: Add form fields for pirate attributes -->
<!-- Include fields for: name, weight, height -->
<!-- Use proper Rails form helpers like text_field -->

<!-- TODO: Add nested form fields for ships using fields_for -->
<!-- Create fields for TWO ships using fields_for helper -->
<!-- Each ship needs: name, type, booty attributes -->
<!-- Example: form.fields_for :ships do |ship_form| -->

<!-- TODO: Add specific IDs for ship fields to match test expectations -->
<!-- First ship fields should have IDs: ship_name_1, ship_type_1, ship_booty_1 -->
<!-- Second ship fields should have IDs: ship_name_2, ship_type_2, ship_booty_2 -->

<!-- TODO: Add a submit button -->
<!-- The button should have the text "Submit" to match test expectations -->

<!-- HINT: You'll need to build ship objects in the controller for the form -->
<!-- HINT: Remember to set up nested attributes in the Pirate model -->
<!-- HINT: Use accepts_nested_attributes_for :ships in the Pirate model -->
